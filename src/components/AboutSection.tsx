            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900">I help founders build and optimise Bubble apps with clean logic, automation, and AI-ready structure.</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
              I'm Al Baloshi Nawaz (Baloshi69), a certified Bubble.io developer and Google IT Support Specialist. I work directly with founders, operators, and small teams who need
              fast, reliable development without the delays or miscommunication that come with agency layers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
              When you work with me, you speak directly to the person designing, building, integrating, and deploying your app. I handle everything end-to-end: front-end UI, database
              structure, workflows, API connections, automation systems, AI features, testing, optimisation, and launch.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
              My priority is always the same: clean logic, scalable architecture, transparent communication, and shipping builds that are stable for real users and fast enough to grow.
